# NotKidding

this repo has the function for every question from Striver's sheet in a basic form.
problems are inside the sub-section folder which is inside the section folder, i.e. NotKidding is the name of the repo then ThingsToKnow(subfolder) is inside
LearnTheBasics(folder).
Similarly, for every other section like 'Learn Important Sorting Techniques, 'Solve Problem on Arrays' and so on until the last topics, subfolders are there 
either named after a particular technique like 'merge, or 'insertion' or after the level of the problem like 'easy', 'medium' or 'hard' and then every problem 
solved precisely in a stepwise manner as given in the sheet has been solved.
